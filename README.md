# vue-proper-demo

This is a demo of using a _dev branch_ [vue-proper package](https://github.com/valango/vue-proper).

To try the 'official' npm package, check out to `master` branch of this repo.

Clone this repository, then:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
... and have fun! ;)

This demo is based on Vue.js demo project auto-generated by `vue-cli`.
The original HelloWorld.vue component is renamed and preserved in 
src/components directory for comparision. It is not in use, though.
